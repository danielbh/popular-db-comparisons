### Cost Analysis

* Cost is based on provisioned throughput
* Hot partitions lead to massive cost

### Deployment/Operations

* Fully managed, but need to track costs carefully.
### Use-Cases

* Duolingo: Supports high throughput with ease
* GE Healthcare: Supports enterprise workloads on cloud
* Docomo: marketing data (user events, profiles, clicks). Ad targeting, attribution, real-time bidding
* Hess Coporation: Used to separate buyer data

### Drawbacks

* Need to be careful about partition keys, hot partitions can lead to massive cost.
